# Internship Tasks Repository

This repository is created to store and manage all the tasks assigned during the internship.  
Each week, new tasks will be added and completed within this repository. All code implementations, including Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks, will be maintained here for consistency and collaboration.  

## ðŸš€ Current Work: Feature Engineering on Learner Dataset
As part of the initial task, we performed **feature engineering** on the dataset of learners and opportunities.  

### Features Added
1. **Age** â€“ Age of applicant at the time of application.  
2. **Opportunity Duration** â€“ Duration of each opportunity in days.  
3. **Application Duration** â€“ Time difference between application date and opportunity closing date.  

### How It Works
- Dataset is loaded using `pandas`.  
- Date columns are converted to `datetime` format.  
- New features are generated through date difference operations.
